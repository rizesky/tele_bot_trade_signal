```bash
# 1. Configure the .env file
cp env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys and settings

# 2. Run with Docker
docker run -d --name trading-bot --env-file .env -v $(pwd)/charts:/app/charts tele-bot-trading

```

### **Modes of Operation**

#### **Simulation Mode** (Recommended for Testing)
```bash
# Set in .env
SIMULATION_MODE=1
DATA_TESTING=0
```
**Features:**
- Generates real signals with reduced cooldown (5 minutes vs 10 minutes)
- No actual trading - safe for testing
- Perfect for strategy validation and system testing

**Relaxed Strategy Conditions:**
- ‚úÖ **24/7 Trading**: No trading hours restrictions
- ‚úÖ **Volume Bypass**: Skips volume confirmation requirements
- ‚úÖ **Simple MA Crossover**: Only requires price crossing moving average
- ‚úÖ **No RSI Filtering**: Removes RSI overbought/oversold conditions
- ‚úÖ **No Market Regime Filtering**: Works in any market condition (TRENDING, RANGING, VOLATILE)

*Result: Much higher signal frequency for easier testing of notifications, charting, and system behavior*

#### **Data Testing Mode** (Development)
```bash
# Set in .env  
DATA_TESTING=1
```
- Generates test signals immediately
- No real market data needed
- For development and debugging

#### **Live Trading Mode** (Production)
```bash
# Set in .env
SIMULATION_MODE=0
DATA_TESTING=0
```
**Features:**
- Real market signals with full cooldown periods (10 minutes default)
- Production-ready operation with all safety measures
- Conservative approach for actual trading

**Strict Strategy Conditions:**
- üîí **Trading Hours**: Respects active market session times
- üîí **Volume Confirmation**: Requires 20% above average volume
- üîí **MA + RSI**: Needs both moving average crossover AND RSI confirmation
  - BUY: Price crosses above MA + RSI < 40 (oversold recovery)
  - SELL: Price crosses below MA + RSI > 60 (overbought decline)
- üîí **Market Regime Filtering**: Only trades in appropriate market conditions
- üîí **Higher Timeframe Confirmation**: Validates signals against broader trends

*Result: Lower signal frequency but higher quality, more reliable trading signals*

## üîç **Signal Quality Features**

## üõ†Ô∏è **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues**

#### **WebSocket Connection Problems**
```bash
# Check if Binance is accessible
curl -I https://fapi.binance.com/fapi/v1/ping

# Check logs for reconnection attempts
docker logs trading-bot | grep "WebSocket"
```

#### **Chart Generation Issues**
```bash
# Check if charts directory exists and is writable
ls -la charts/
chmod 755 charts/

# Check Playwright installation
docker exec trading-bot playwright --version
```

#### **API Rate Limiting**
```bash
# Reduce symbol count in .env
SYMBOLS=BTCUSDT,ETHUSDT  # Start with fewer symbols

# Enable lazy loading
LAZY_LOADING_ENABLED=1
MAX_LAZY_LOAD_SYMBOLS=20
```

#### **Memory Issues**
```bash
# Monitor memory usage
docker stats trading-bot

# Reduce historical data
HISTORY_CANDLES=100  # Instead of 200
```

### **Log Analysis**
```bash
# View all logs
docker logs trading-bot

# Filter for signals only
docker logs trading-bot | grep "Signal detected"

# Filter for errors
docker logs trading-bot | grep "ERROR"

# Follow logs in real-time
docker logs -f trading-bot
```

### **Performance Monitoring**
```bash
# Check resource usage
docker stats trading-bot

# Check chart generation
ls -la charts/ | wc -l

# Monitor WebSocket connections
docker logs trading-bot | grep "WebSocket"
```

## üìä **Performance Metrics**

### **Signal Quality Indicators**
- **Volume Ratio**: Should be > 1.2x average
- **Market Regime**: Trending markets preferred
- **Higher TF Alignment**: Confirms signal direction
- **RSI Levels**: Oversold (< 40) for BUY, Overbought (> 60) for SELL

### **System Performance**
- **Memory Usage**: ~200-500MB depending on symbols
- **CPU Usage**: ~10-30% during active trading
- **Chart Generation**: ~2-5 seconds per chart
- **Signal Frequency**: 1-5 signals per hour (depending on market)

## üîí **Security Best Practices**

### **API Key Security**
- Use Binance API keys with **Futures Trading** enabled only
- Set **IP restrictions** on API keys
- Use **read-only** keys for data fetching


### **Deployment Security**
- Run in isolated Docker containers
- Use VPN for geo-restricted regions

### Important Considerations
#### Binance Geo-Restrictions and VPN Usage
Due to regulatory restrictions, Binance services are not available in all countries.
Attempting to access Binance from a restricted location, even with an API key, can lead to account being frozen or suspended. 
If located in a region where Binance is blocked, a VPN must be used.

**Cautionary List**:
 - Absolute Ban: Countries like Algeria, Bangladesh, China, Egypt, Iraq, Morocco, Nepal, Qatar, and Tunisia have strict cryptocurrency regulations that could prevent Binance access.
 - Implicit Ban/Restrictions: Many other countries, including the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, and several European nations, have complex regulations or regional restrictions.
 - Always check the official Binance website for the most up-to-date information on service availability in the area. 

**Best Practice for VPN Use with Binance**:
 - Use a reliable VPN provider.
 - Connect to a server in a supported country where there is a verified account.
 - Do not switch VPN locations while trading, as this can trigger security alerts and cause account to be locked.
 - Avoid locations with known issues. For instance, accessing Binance International from the US is a known cause of account suspension.
 - Use the API from a static IP address. Some VPNs offer static IP addresses, which is preferable to dynamic ones.
